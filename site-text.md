# SinglePassword

Imagine a Password Vault where you don't have to save your passwords.

SinglePassword is exactly that. Just remember a single password and singlepassword will generate unique passwords for each site you login. 
This is far more secure and reliable as you don't  save password in a single place. Or anywhere for that matter.

# How it works

### 1. The Super Password

Find yourself a single password which you won't ever forget. We'll call it The Super Password.

### 2. Sub Password Generation

Use Sub passwords for your accounts. If you want to see them again, generate the exact same Password using the same Super Password
