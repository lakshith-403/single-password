# Introduction

Imagine a Password Vault where you don't have to save your passwords.

SinglePassword is exactly that. Just remember a single password and singlepassword will generate unique passwords for each site you login. 
This is far more secure and reliable as you don't  save password in a single place. Or anywhere for that matter.

# How it works

Find yourself a single password which you won't ever forget. We'll call it the super password.

When we're given your super password and the site you want to create the password for, we combine those data and create an encrypted phrase.

Then we make that phrase 'less gibberish' making it easier for you to remember that in case you have to enter it regularly.

This 'less giberish' encrypted phrase is your generated password

# Why should you trust us

There's no account creation and we don't ask any personal information from you. 

Even if we were bad people, there's literally nothing we can do to harm you as you're 100% annonymous.
